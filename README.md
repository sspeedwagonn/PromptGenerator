# PromptGenerator

PromptGenerator is a tool for creative writers to write stories based off of random prompts. Writers can view their word count and save their works as text files!

This is my first time using PyQt! Been a great experience thus far :)!

## Version 0.1
Version 0.1 includes the basic abilities to generate prompts and write based on them, view word count, and save files.

### Install and Use
1. Visit the [Releases tab](https://github.com/sspeedwagonn/PromptGenerator/releases/tag/v0.1)
2. Download `promptgenerator-0.1.exe`
3. Run it and enjoy it!
## Future Versions
Future versions will include a more polished GUI with more abilities! This will eventually be worked into a larger creative writing software.
